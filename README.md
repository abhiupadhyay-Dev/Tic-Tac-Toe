# Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This is a simple implementation of the classic game where two players take turns marking a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Rules of the Game

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to mark a cell with their symbol (X or O).
3. The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
4. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

Enjoy playing and have fun!
